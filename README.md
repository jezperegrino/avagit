# Avagit

This project seeks to decentralize the developers' projects and be able to provide some economic benefit to those who create tools that support communities and companies but also provide security to those who consume these projects.

To solve these problems we face, we use web3 technologies offered by projects such as Avalanche and ICP.

## Avalanche

``` bash
```

## Internet Computing (ICP)

```bash
npm i
dfx deploy
```
